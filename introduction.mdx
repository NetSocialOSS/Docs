## Safe URLS
The URLs that we use at Net Social such as *.netsocial.app and *.netsocial.co.in are the only and safest to use and work with. Other than that we, don't have any other Domain we operate upon so if you find some strange link that is similar or look-a-like of NetSocial and further goes on stealing your stuff we are not responsible for it.
